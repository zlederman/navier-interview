# Navier.ai Interview Challenge - airfRANS Dataset

## Understanding the data
- Downloaded Data
- Asking claude what a vtp and vtu is
- Installed Paraview
- Understanding file naming conventions
    probably going to have to parse out the name
- Clues on where to proceed

Objective:
Prepare a dataset for training an ML model on the airfRANS data.

The airfRANS dataset is a collection of airfoils and their RANS simulation solution. The documentation describes the dataset and the functionality in the Python library they've built in detail.

Ask:

Create a dataset for training an ML model using the airfRANS dataset.
The dataset should proivde a sequence of points with their SDF (distance from the airfoil) value as the input (x, y, sdf) and the velocity (x, y, v_x, v_y) as the target. Package the data such that it can be quickly loaded for training a model.
Provide some dataset statistics to help users understand the data.
Document your design decisions.

Freestream refers to the flow conditions far away from the airfoil where the air is undisturbed by the airfoil's presence. In your ParaView visualization, the "freestream.vtp" file typically contains information about these outer boundary conditions. Think of it as describing what the air is doing "at infinity" or far enough away that the airfoil's effects have disappeared. This is where:

The velocity returns to the original incoming flow speed
Pressure returns to atmospheric conditions
There's no turbulence generated by the airfoil
Flow patterns are uniform and undisturbed

Internal, represented by your "internal.vtu" file, describes what's happening in the computational domain around the airfoil where the flow is being affected by the airfoil's presence. This region includes:

The boundary layer near the airfoil surface
The wake region behind the airfoil
Areas where pressure and velocity are changing due to the airfoil
Regions where turbulence is being generated and dissipated

The key difference shows up in the file formats too - the freestream using VTP (polygon data) since it's often just defining boundary surfaces, while internal uses VTU (unstructured grid) because it needs to capture the complex 3D volume where all the interesting fluid dynamics happen.
This separation is crucial for numerical simulations because it helps define where detailed calculations are needed (internal) versus where simplified conditions can be assumed (freestream), making the computation more efficient while maintaining accuracy where it matters most.
